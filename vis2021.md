title: Workshop at IEEE VIS 2021
---

## Agenda

This workshop aims to build a community of researchers from both
the visualization and the sonification communities and to work towards
a common language, find research gaps, and identify directions
for research on audio-visual data analysis idioms. We scheduled
the larger part of the day for group and plenary discussions.
Therefore, there will be no call for presenters and it is open to
all IEEE VIS 2021 attendees. We expect the workshop to result
in an outline for a research agenda to combine visualization and
sonification.
